# Maintainer meetings minutes - Year 2025

## June 23, 2025

### Participants

- Alessandro Olivero
- Francesco Cheinasso
- Francesco Torta
- Fulvio Risso

### Agenda

- Discussion about increasing the number of maintainers
- Plans for the next community meeting

### Minutes

Given that two of the current maintainers will move to another job soon and it is not yet clear how much time they can dedicate to this project, the question is whether the current list of maintainers is appropriate to serve the requests coming from the community and to drive the future of the Liqo project.
The consensus is to explore the availability of other active developers to join the maintainers team, in order to increase the capability to move the project forward.

For the same reason (potential lack of time), the consensus is to increase the frequency of the maintainers meeting and use this time, tentatively once a week, to discuss about the project, to review pending PRs, and any duties that may require the close coordination among the maintainers.

### Actions

- (FULVIO) Verify if there are other people available to join the maintainers' team
- (FULVIO) Plan the next community meeting for July 7th
