# Maintainer meetings minutes - Year 2025

## Feb 14, 2025

**Participants**
- Alessandro Olivero
- Francesco Cheinasso
- Francesco Torta
- Fulvio Risso

**Agenda**: discussion about how to strengthen the Liqo Community, and how to set up periodic open community meetings. Feedback is that the Liqo project is not perceived as open as it is, and we have to counter this (wrong) impression.

**Actions**:
- Create a channel "community-meetings" on Slack, where to propose next dates and the agenda of the public community meetings. In addition, allow community members to propose new topics for future meetings. [DONE]
- Remove channels "announces" and "random" from Slack (not useful) [DONE]
- Community meeting slot: Monday, 5:30pm, Rome time, about 1 hour. Agenda and exact dates published in advance. Maintainers should try their best to set up at least one meeting each month.
  - Decide a connection link (Fulvio with his Zoom if nothing better is available) [DONE]
- Create a document with rules for engaging with the community meetings [DONE]
- Mention (not yet clear where) that the community development starts by creating a "feature proposal" on github, open for discussion to the entire community [DONE, CREATED A FILE ABOUT COMMUNITY BEST PRACTICES]
- To avoid polluting the main repository of Liqo with tiny details about community meetings (e.g., agenda, minutes), create a separate repository "community" (and here, "/meetings" for agenda and minutes) [DONE]
