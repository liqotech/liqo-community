### Shared resources

Accounts and any other information to access to the shared resources for the Liqo community have been shared among the owners, and kept in a (private) shared document.
Maintainers have agreed to update the permissions to have access to shared and private resources (e.g., GDrive, Slack, ReadtheDocs, etc.)

### Community

The maintainers agreed about the necessity to strengthen the community. In this respect, they agreed to set up a public meeting, tentatively every 4-6 weeks, published in advance, with a well-defined agenda, in order to present the current state of the project and outline future directions.
