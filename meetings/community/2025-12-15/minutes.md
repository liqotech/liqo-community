## Minutes

This meeting was scheduled with an "open agenda", given that several people are working on new features and/or extending Liqo, and the maintainers feel that the best way to provide feedback and guidance at this stage is to setup an interactive video call instead of endless discussions on Slack.

Given that the discussion is mainly oriented to help new contributors on their issues, maintainers decided not to record the event as it would not be very helpful for the broader community.

We summarize here the main points about what has been discussed.

- Follow-up about networking activities from Gabriele Santi: discussion about architectural choices and coding details
- Follow-up about security activities from Riccardo Tornesello: discussion about architectural choices and coding details
- Next release: consensus about creating a new patch release which includes the bug fixes merged so far. The next release should be the 1.1, expected in the early months of 2026.
- Next meeting: no date yet, likely end of Jan / beginning of Feb 2026.
