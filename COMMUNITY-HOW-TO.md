# Liqo Community How-To

**Community meetings** are set up either periodically (e.g., once every 4-6 weeks) or when the discussion on a specific topic is needed (e.g., ideas for future features, new deployment scenarios and/or use cases, new collaboration opportunities, etc.).
In case you would like to propose a new feature, we suggest to open a _feature request_ on the [Liqo GitHub page](https://github.com/liqotech/liqo/issues) in order to describe your idea/request and allow the members of the community to think about your proposal in advance.

The **date** and the **agenda** of the next community meeting is published on this repository (file [meetings/README.md](meetings/README.md)) and advertised on the _#community-meeting_ channel on Slack.

**Proposals for new topics** to be discussed in the community meetings are welcome: please use the _#community-meeting_ channel on Slack to present your idea and propose a tentative agenda.
